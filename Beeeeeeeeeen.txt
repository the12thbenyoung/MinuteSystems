I reorganized the html files. The ones for picking are now in a folder and so are the ones for scanning.

The scan function is almost the same. I just added lines to tell the motors to return home and release.

Not sure how we should do the csv file, you would probably know how to do that better than me.

The functions you need to mess with are:
	scan (maybe)
	nextTray (maybe)
	get_csv_file (maybe) this one should be finished
	picking_scan_tray
	run_tray
	picking_rescan_tray
	scan_tray (This is the one for the scanning not picking side)
